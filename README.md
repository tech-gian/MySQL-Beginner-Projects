# MySQL-Beginner-Projects

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you will find some of my first MySQL projects. I mostly used them to help me practice my knowledge. I gained a lot of beginner's experience through them and it really helped understand some basic principles for Databases, in general.

## Each Project

In each folder, you will find a separate project. So, each folder contains a .mwb file and a .sql file. In these files exist the schema for the database and the corresponding script to reproduce this schema. I didn't used any data to test the database. In some of these projects, there is also a pronunciation. 

This repo is only some beginner's work. For more advanced projects, visit my ðŸ‘‰ [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/tech-gian).
